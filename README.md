In examining the skills required for these high-paying roles, SQL, Python, and Tableau were the most commonâ€”indicating that core, hands-on tools remain highly valuable. When we looked at overall demand across all jobs, it became clear that while programming and data visualization tools are crucial, foundational skills like Excel and SQL are just as important, forming the base of most data workflows.

When analyzing skills based on average salary, we saw that more advanced and technical toolsâ€”like Jupyter, Docker, Airflow, and cloud platforms such as Google Cloud and Databricksâ€”tend to command higher pay. While they werenâ€™t the most commonly listed, their presence in top-paying roles shows the benefit of deepening technical skills.

By combining the results from demand and salary-focused queries, we were able to identify a group of optimal skills to learnâ€”those that are both frequently requested and financially rewarding. These include a mix of in-demand programming languages, cloud tools, BI platforms, and niche technologies. Overall, this project helped apply SQL in a meaningful, real-world context and offered valuable insight into how data analysts can strategically shape their learning to align with career goals.

### my takeaways
Although I already understood the basics of SQL, this project allowed me to practice more intermediate skills in a practical, job-focused dataset.
I used LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN to combine multiple tablesâ€”such as linking job postings with companies and connecting jobs to their listed skillsâ€”enabling deeper analysis across related data.
I implemented CASE expressions to create conditional logic within queries, helping me categorize or transform results based on specific rules.
These techniques made it possible to answer more complex questions about which skills are most valuable and in demand for data analysts.

Outside of SQL, I also gained experience with Git by regularly committing changes to my code and tracking progress throughout the project.
Using GitHub, I published my work in a clear, organized repositoryâ€”complete with SQL scripts, markdown documentation, and visual outputs.
This process not only helped me document my learning journey but also gave me something tangible to share on LinkedIn and include in a growing portfolio.

Overall, this project helped me move from learning SQL in isolation to applying it in a real-world setting, while also developing practical skills in version control and project sharing using Git and GitHub.
