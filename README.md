# Introduction

This dataset provided in Luke Barousse's SQL for Data Analytics course contains data on a collection of hiring posts for data analytic roles including job title, location, salary and skills. The goal in this guided project is to analyse the dataset to answer question like what are the top paying skills? I chose this project to help develop my SQL knowledge in a practical environment.

# To be exact the questions I wanted to answer through SQL queries were:  
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?  
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The code of my analysis, allowing me to query the database to achieve critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
