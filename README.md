# Introduction

This dataset provided in Luke Barousse's SQL for Data Analytics course contains data on a collection of hiring posts for data analytic roles including job title, location, salary and skills. The goal in this guided project is to analyse the dataset to answer question like what are the top paying skills?

The dataset and Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). 

# To be exact the questions I wanted to answer through SQL queries were:  
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?  
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
